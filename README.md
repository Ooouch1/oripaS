History of updates
-------

* __2012/10/07 Bug fix:__
   * Speed up: finding the nearest vertex, pasting lines and adding line. Maybe it won't hang up now. 
   (but slow in a test with 100*100 grid data.)
   * Bug fixed. The last update was incomplete :P
   * Correct origin position of second copy(cut)-and-paste.
<p></p>

* __2012/09/29 Bug fix:__
   * Cut-and-copy mode by Ctrl+x. (Actually the crash was not a bug. Closing window was a correct action defined by MITANI Jun.)
   * Behavior of right click on copy-and-paste mode becomes the same as original ORIPA. 
     It will finish copy & paste then get back to last selection mode ("Select" or mirror copy).
<p></p>

* __2012/09/17 Bug fix:__
    * Behavior of right click on copy-and-paste mode becomes similar to original ORIPA. It will get back to "Select" mode.
<p></p>


* __2012/09/08 Improve usability:__
    * On copy-and-paste mode, you can select the origin vertex by pressing Ctrl key.
<p></p>

* __2012/08/28 Bug fix, improve usability:__
    * Undo of changing line type is fixed.
    * Ctrl + z acts as undo command the same as right mouse button.
    * On mirror-copy mode, you can select multi-lines by Dragging.
    * On delete-line mode, you can delete multi-lines by Dragging.	
    * It comfirms to save on closing window if you have edited.
    * Codes for inputting line are refactored (just partially).
<p></p>
 	

* __2012/07/15 Bug fix:__
    * Codes for inputting line are refactored (just partially).
    * Undo of mirror copy is available.
    * It corrects a problem that the color of selected line remains green.
